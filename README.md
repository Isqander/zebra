# Zebra puzzle solver

### Features
* Using backtracking with previous filtering for optimisation
* Other algorithms can be implemented using the Solver interface
* There is no exceptions in case of no answers, just empty output
* Application can receive different variations of attributes and constrains
* In cases where the constraints allow for multiple answers, a combination of them is returned
* Pagination can be used for user convenience

### Ways to improve
* Try another algorithms e.g. AC3
* In case of complex calculations pagination give fast results just for a number of first combinations, in some use-cases it's appropriate decision, in some cashing can partly solve the problem, or another algorithm
